# Whow

## About

**Whow** - When, How?

Whow is a CLI To-do application, with features such as:
 * A calendar that supports features like tags and importance,
 * To-Dos (of course)
 * Events
 * A Daily Schedule

And counting. Whow is a CLI application rewritten in Python with more features than the old shell-script version that can be found [here.](https://github.com/DaringCuteSeal/whow) It aims to include extra features such as

 * Filesystem Structure for organizing files
 * A `toml` configuration instead of a simple `rc`

and more to come.

## Development Status

This program is under the initial bring-up stage. Do not expect working code till this message goes away in the `README`!

## Currently Working on:
 * taking a GOOD rest

## Planned Features (high priority):
 * [ ] Transition from toml to json becuase toml is overkill
 * [ ] add support for PyPy3.9 (maybe?)
 * [ ] Refactor our code for the whow API
 * [ ] get this on the PyPI
 * [ ] OTA Update tool
 * [ ] Daily Schedule
 * [ ] Sorting To-Dos and events by time
 * [ ] Document our code also for the whow API

## Planned features (low priority):
 * [ ] Reminders
 * [ ] `whowd`, a daemon for whow using things like libnotify
 * [ ] A reference implementation for an alternative frontend
 * [ ] `curses` frontend to whow
